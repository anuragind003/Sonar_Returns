# Sonar_Returns
This repository contains a machine learning project that classifies sonar signals to distinguish between rocks and metal cylinders (mines) based on the Sonar dataset. The dataset includes sonar returns from an underwater sonar system, and the goal is to predict whether a given sonar return indicates a rock or a mine.
